# 🚀 API Testing Projects & Documentation



## 🌟 Overview
This repository showcases my expertise in API testing using Postman, including structured test plans, test cases, and Newman HTML reports. It demonstrates my ability to validate API functionality, automate test execution, and document processes effectively.

## 📌 API Testing Projects
Here’s a structured list of API projects I have worked on, covering various testing methodologies and automation strategies:

| 🔢 No. | 📌 Project Name | 📋 Description |
|----|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1  | **Project #1 - JSON Server API** | Tested CRUD operations using Postman collections |
| 2  | **Project #2 - SOAP API Testing** | Performed SOAP API testing using Postman |
| 3  | **Project #2 - Opencart Registration** | Tested user registration flow in Opencart API |
| 4  | **Project #3 - Restful Booker API** | Automated API testing for a hotel booking system |
| 5  | **Project #4 - API Testing CRUD** | Validated CRUD operations in various APIs |

## 📂 Documentation & Reports
In addition to API testing, I have documented my testing process using structured reports and artifacts:

📌 **Test Plans** – Created detailed API test plans to define scope and approach.
📌 **Test Cases** – Designed and managed test scenarios in Excel & Postman.
📌 **Postman Collections** – Automated API testing workflows using scripts.
📌 **Newman Reports** – Generated execution reports for test runs.
